# Gumroad Trial
 Hypothetical Gumroad Design Challenge

I created a hypothetical Gumroad feature that integrates personable AI characters with the website in order to help sellers find other people to collaborate with, to improve their storefront, and take actionable steps based on their analytics.

Basically, on the Dashboard (https://app.gumroad.com/dashboard), I want to integrate a useful assistant for the point of view of the seller to be able to understand how to improve their storefront and make more sales, and collaborate with others.

Features it should have:
- A character that is personable and helpful
- A way to find other sellers to collaborate with
- A way to improve their storefront using AI
- A way to take actionable steps based on their analytics
